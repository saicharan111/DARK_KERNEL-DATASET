# DARK_KERNEL-DATASET
This repository contains the anonymised PCAP files captured during the DARK-KERNEL deployment in C3i Hub


# Description of the DATASET
In this dataset we have 3 PCAP file coresponding to 3 attack scenarios that we discussed in the paper.
1) 27-05-22.pcap corresponds to attack scenario-1
2) 24-05-22.pcap corresponds to attack scenario-2
3) 06-04-22.pcap corresponds to attack scenario-3

## NOTE
All the pcap files are anonymized, meaning that DARK-IP addresses monitored for the analysis and the corresponding MAC address of the DARK-KERNEL sensor machine are anonymized.
